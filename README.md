# The-Strange-Elevator
You are on the ground floor of a 10-story building, waiting for the elevator. When the elevator arrives, you notice there is a stranger inside who seems a bit peculiar. The stranger tells you, "Every time the elevator goes up, it will come down two floors afterward. And every time it goes down, it will come up three floors afterward." The stranger then leaves the elevator and walks away. If you want to reach the 10th floor, how many times do you need to take the elevator?

Solution 1: You only need to take the elevator once. Since the elevator goes up and comes down two floors afterward, it will keep ascending by one floor each time. So, after taking the elevator once, you will reach the 10th floor directly.
